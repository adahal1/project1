<div class="left">
<p>Johny decided to go on a vacation to Bahamas. He had a lot of fun, he did many things there with his friends there. He wanted to go to a place with different islands and that has a lot of activities you can do for. He went to many resort places to stay and relax at work a week. He also went scuba diving and went to a lot of snorkeling sites.  </p>
</br>
<p> For his next trip from Bahamas he was planning to go to a place where he can go rock climbing. He has always wanted to go to a spot where he can go rock climbing. He likes to feel the the adrealnin rush when he goes to high elevated spots. So he picked 2 places that are quite dangerous and pretty high peaks. He wants to go either to Mount Fuji or Mount Everest. Choose where you want johnny to go next:
