<p>This was the last trip for Johnny before he started to look for work in his major. He was a computer science major so he wanted to go to Japan to see how advanced their technology and everything was. His dream job was a job in google headquaters in Mountain View, CA. He also went to Japan because of all thei anime work and he also likes their traditions</p>
</br>
<p>After Johnny was done exploring in Japan he decided to come back to the Bay Area and apply for multple jobs. He had built his resume quite well so he got the dream job he wanted at google. He enjoyed all the time he had there and now it was time for him to start working.</p>
