<h1>Santa Monica</h1>

<div class="left">
<p>Johnny visited Santa Monica in Los Angelos by himself. He wanted to enjoy the sun after a very eventful and scary trip he had. He also decided to go to the pier and enjoy before he had to come back to the bay area. He was going to apply to jobs after he was back.  </p>
