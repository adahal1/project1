<div class="left">
<p>This was Johnny's last trip that he ever went to. He was having a lot fun. His friends decided to come back a little early from spain to the United States because their works were starting. So, he decided to stay at the beach they were close by for a extra day, he didn't know how to swim either but he still wanted to go to the beach. After that he decided to go to beach. He shouln't of went by himself. He drowned in the water because there were a lot of high tides that day. It was a very sad event and day for everyone because they lost good son, hard working student who had just graduated from college.  </p>
